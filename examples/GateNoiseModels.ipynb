    "There are two basic types of quantum gate errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **coherent errors** are those that preserve the purity of the input state, i.e., instead of the above mapping we carry out a perturbed, but unitary operation $\\ket{\\psi} \\mapsto \\tilde{U}\\ket{\\psi}$, where $\\tilde{U} \\neq U$.  \n",
    "2. **incoherent errors** are those that do not preserve the purity of the input state, \n",
