    "Qubit-Readout can be corrupted in a variety of ways. The two most relevant error mechanisms on the Rigetti QPU right now are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transmission line noise that makes a 0-state look like a 1-state or vice versa. We call this **classical readout bit-flip error**. This type of readout noise can be reduced by tailoring optimal readout pulses and using superconducting, quantum limited amplifiers to amplify the readout signal before it is corrupted by classical noise at the higher temperature stages of our cryostats.\n",
    "2. T1 qubit decay during readout (our readout operations can take more than a µsecond unless they have been specially optimized), which leads to readout signals that initially behave like 1-states but then collapse to something resembling a 0-state. We will call this **T1-readout error**. This type of readout error can be reduced by achieving shorter readout pulses relative to the T1 time, i.e., one can try to reduce the readout pulse length, or increase the T1 time or both."

    "T1 type errors fall outside our framework so far as they involve a scenario in which the _quantum state itself_ is corrupted during the measurement process in a way that potentially erases the pre-measurement information as opposed to a loss of purely classical information. The most appropriate framework for describing this is given by that of measurement instruments, but for the practical purpose of arriving at a relatively simple description, we propose describing this by a T1 damping Kraus map followed by the noisy readout process as described above."
