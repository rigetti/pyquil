# PyQuil API usage examples

This directory contains a few select examples for what you are able to
do with the `pyquil` API.
To use these examples, we recommend that you actually clone the pyquil
git repository or [download it via this link.](https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/archive/master.zip)
Furthermore, you will have to install pyquil and its requirements but
also some additional requirements specific to the examples:

```sh
cd YOUR/LOCAL/PYQUIL
pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
```

where you must replace `YOUR/LOCAL/PYQUIL` with the path to where you
downloaded/cloned pyquil to.
