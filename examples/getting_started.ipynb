    "This toolkit provides some simple libraries for writing quantum programs using the quantum instruction language Quil. pyQuil is part of the [Forest](http://forest.rigetti.com) suite of tools for quantum programming and is currently in private beta.\n",

    "\n",
    "It comes with a few parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quil**: The Quantum Instruction Language standard. Instructions written in Quil can be executed on any implementation of a quantum abstract machine, such as the quantum virtual machine (QVM), or on a real quantum processing unit (QPU). More details regarding Quil can be found in the [whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03355).\n",
    "2. **QVM**: A Quantum Virtual Machine, which is an implementation of the quantum abstract machine on classical hardware.  The QVM lets you use a regular computer to simulate a small quantum computer.  You can access the Rigetti QVM running in the cloud with your API key.  Sign up [here](http://forest.rigetti.com) to get your key.\n",
    "3. **pyQuil**: A Python library to help write and run Quil code and quantum programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure that you have an installation of Python 2.7 (version 2.7.10 or greater) and the Python package manager pip. We recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for an all-in-one installation of Python 2.7. If pip is not installed, it can be installed with `easy_install pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "After obtaining pyQuil from [GitHub](https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyquil) or from a source distribution, navigate into its directory in a terminal and run\n",

    "```\n",
    "pip install pyquil\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The library will now be available globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to a Rigetti QVM\n",
    "In order to connect to a Rigetti QVM you need to configure your pyQuil installation with your QVM API key. For permanent one-time setup, you can do this by creating a file in your home directory with the following lines:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Rigetti Forest]\n",
    "url: <FOREST_URL>\n",
    "key: <YOUR_FOREST_API_KEY>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Look [here](http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#connecting-to-a-rigetti-qvm) to see more information about setting up your connection to Forest.\n",
    "\n",
