    The platonic ideal of this class is as a generic interface describing how a classical computer

    The reality is that neither the QPU nor the QVM currently support a full-on QPI interface,
    and so the undignified job of this class is to collect enough state that it can convincingly
    pretend to be a QPI-compliant quantum computer.
