        Raises a ``RegisterMatrixConversionError`` if the inner execution data for any of the
        registers would result in a jagged matrix. QPU result data is captured per measure,
        meaning a value is returned for every measure to a memory reference, not just once per shot.
        This is often the case in programs that re-use qubits or dynamic control flow, where
        measurements to the same memory reference might occur multiple times in a shot, or be skipped
        conditionally. In these cases, building a matrix with one value per memory reference, per shot
        would necessitate making assumptions about the data that could skew the data in undesirable
        ways. Instead, it's recommended to manually build a matrix from the ``QPUResultData`` available
        on the ``raw_readout_data`` property.

            An exception will _not_ be raised if the result data happens to fit a rectangular matrix, since
            it's possible the register map is valid for some number of shots. Users should be aware of this
            possibility, especially when running programs that utilize qubit reuse or dynamic control flow.
