        Run an ``Experiment`` on a QVM or QPU backend. An ``Experiment`` is composed of:

            - A main ``Program`` body (or ansatz).
            - A collection of ``ExperimentSetting`` objects, each of which encodes a particular
              state preparation and measurement.
            - A ``SymmetrizationLevel`` for enacting different readout symmetrization strategies.
            - A number of shots to collect for each (unsymmetrized) ``ExperimentSetting``.

        Because the main ``Program`` is static from run to run of an ``Experiment``, we can leverage
        our platform's Parametric Compilation feature. This means that the ``Program`` can be
        compiled only once, and the various alterations due to state preparation, measurement,
        and symmetrization can all be realized at runtime by providing a ``memory_map``. Thus, the
        steps in the ``experiment`` method are as follows:

           1. Generate a parameterized program corresponding to the ``Experiment``
              (see the ``Experiment.generate_experiment_program()`` method for more
              details on how it changes the main body program to support state preparation,
              measurement, and symmetrization).

            2. Compile the parameterized program into a parametric (binary) executable, which
               contains declared variables that can be assigned at runtime.

            3. For each ``ExperimentSetting`` in the ``Experiment``, we repeat the following:

                a. Build a collection of memory maps that correspond to the various state
                   preparation, measurement, and symmetrization specifications.
                b. Run the parametric executable on the QVM or QPU backend, providing the memory map
                   to assign variables at runtime.
                c. Extract the desired statistics from the classified bitstrings that are produced
                   by the QVM or QPU backend, and package them in an ``ExperimentResult`` object.

            3. Return the list of ``ExperimentResult`` objects.

        This method is extremely useful shorthand for running near-term applications and algorithms,
        which often have this ansatz + settings structure.

        :param experiment: The ``Experiment`` to run.
        :param memory_map: A dictionary mapping declared variables / parameters to their values.
            The values are a list of floats or integers. Each float or integer corresponds to
            a particular classical memory register. The memory map provided to the ``experiment``
            method corresponds to variables in the main body program that we would like to change
            at runtime (e.g. the variational parameters provided to the ansatz of the variational
            quantum eigensolver).

        Run a quil program in such a way that the readout error is made symmetric. Enforcing
        symmetric readout error is useful in simplifying the assumptions in some near
        term error mitigation strategies, see ``measure_observables`` for more information.

        The simplest example is for one qubit. In a noisy quantum_processor, the probability of accurately
        reading the 0 state might be higher than that of the 1 state; due to e.g. amplitude
        damping. This makes correcting for readout more difficult. In the simplest case, this
        function runs the program normally ``(trials//2)`` times. The other half of the time,
        it will insert an ``X`` gate prior to any ``MEASURE`` instruction and then flip the
        measured classical bit back. Overall this has the effect of symmetrizing the readout error.

        The details. Consider preparing the input bitstring ``|i>`` (in the computational basis) and
        measuring in the Z basis. Then the Confusion matrix for the readout error is specified by
        the probabilities

             p(j|i) := Pr(measured = j | prepared = i ).

        In the case of a single qubit i,j \in [0,1] then:
        there is no readout error if p(0|0) = p(1|1) = 1.
        the readout error is symmetric if p(0|0) = p(1|1) = 1 - epsilon.
        the readout error is asymmetric if p(0|0) != p(1|1).

        If your quantum computer has this kind of asymmetric readout error then
        ``qc.run_symmetrized_readout`` will symmetrize the readout error.

        The readout error above is only asymmetric on a single bit. In practice the confusion
        matrix on n bits need not be symmetric, e.g. for two qubits p(ij|ij) != 1 - epsilon for
        all i,j. In these situations a more sophisticated means of symmetrization is needed; and
        we use orthogonal arrays (OA) built from Hadamard matrices.

        The symmetrization types are specified by an int; the types available are:
        -1 -- exhaustive symmetrization uses every possible combination of flips
        0 -- trivial that is no symmetrization
        1 -- symmetrization using an OA with strength 1
        2 -- symmetrization using an OA with strength 2
        3 -- symmetrization using an OA with strength 3
        In the context of readout symmetrization the strength of the orthogonal array enforces
        the symmetry of the marginal confusion matrices.

        By default a strength 3 OA is used; this ensures expectations of the form
        ``<b_k . b_j . b_i>`` for bits any bits i,j,k will have symmetric readout errors. Here
        expectation of a random variable x as is denote ``<x> = sum_i Pr(i) x_i``. It turns out that
        a strength 3 OA is also a strength 2 and strength 1 OA it also ensures ``<b_j . b_i>`` and
        ``<b_i>`` have symmetric readout errors for any bits b_j and b_i.

    Get a quantum computer.

    A quantum computer is an object of type :py:class:`QuantumComputer` and can be backed
    either by a QVM simulator ("Quantum/Quil Virtual Machine") or a physical Rigetti QPU ("Quantum
    Processing Unit") made of superconducting qubits.

    You can choose the quantum computer to target through a combination of its name and optional
    flags. There are multiple ways to get the same quantum computer. The following are equivalent::

        >>> qc = get_qc("Aspen-1-16Q-A-noisy-qvm")
        >>> qc = get_qc("Aspen-1-16Q-A", as_qvm=True, noisy=True)

    and will construct a simulator of an Aspen-1 lattice with a noise model based on quantum_processor
    characteristics. We also provide a means for constructing generic quantum simulators that
    are not related to a given piece of Rigetti hardware::

        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-square-qvm")
        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-square", as_qvm=True)

    Finally, you can get request a QVM with "no" topology of a given number of qubits
    (technically, it's a fully connected graph among the given number of qubits) with::

        >>> qc = get_qc("5q-qvm") # or "6q-qvm", or "34q-qvm", ...

    These less-realistic, fully-connected QVMs will also be more lenient on what types of programs
    they will ``run``. Specifically, you do not need to do any compilation. For the other, realistic
    QVMs you must use :py:func:`qc.compile` or :py:func:`qc.compiler.native_quil_to_executable`
    prior to :py:func:`qc.run`.

    The Rigetti QVM must be downloaded from https://www.rigetti.com/forest and run as a server
    alongside your python program. To use pyQuil's built-in QVM, replace all ``"-qvm"`` suffixes
    with ``"-pyqvm"``::

        >>> qc = get_qc("5q-pyqvm")

    Redundant flags are acceptable, but conflicting flags will raise an exception::

        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-square-qvm") # qc is fully specified by its name
        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-square-qvm", as_qvm=True) # redundant, but ok
        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-square-qvm", as_qvm=False) # Error!

    Use :py:func:`list_quantum_computers` to retrieve a list of known qc names.

    This method is provided as a convenience to quickly construct and use QVM's and QPU's.
    Power users may wish to have more control over the specification of a quantum computer
    (e.g. custom noise models, bespoke topologies, etc.). This is possible by constructing
    a :py:class:`QuantumComputer` object by hand. Please refer to the documentation on
    :py:class:`QuantumComputer` for more information.

        "-noisy-qvm" will return a QVM with a noise model. Otherwise, we will return a QPU with
        the given name.
    :param as_qvm: An optional flag to force construction of a QVM (instead of a QPU). If
        specified and set to ``True``, a QVM-backed quantum computer will be returned regardless
        of the name's suffix
    :param noisy: An optional flag to force inclusion of a noise model. If
        specified and set to ``True``, a quantum computer with a noise model will be returned
        regardless of the name's suffix. The generic QVM noise model is simple T1 and T2 noise
        plus readout error. See :py:func:`~pyquil.noise.decoherence_noise_with_asymmetric_ro`.
        Note, we currently do not support noise models based on QCS hardware; a value of
        `True`` will result in an error if the requested QPU is a QCS hardware QPU.

    *  3 -- symmetrization using an OA with strength 3

    In the context of readout symmetrization the strength of the orthogonal array enforces the
    symmetry of the marginal confusion matrices.

    By default a strength 3 OA is used; this ensures expectations of the form <b_k * b_j * b_i>
    for bits any bits i,j,k will have symmetric readout errors. Here expectation of a random
    variable x as is denote <x> = sum_i Pr(i) x_i. It turns out that a strength 3 OA is also a
    strength 2 and strength 1 OA it also ensures <b_j * b_i> and <b_i> have symmetric readout
    errors for any bits b_j and b_i.
