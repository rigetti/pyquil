        r"""
        Run a quil program in such a way that the readout error is made symmetric. Enforcing
        symmetric readout error is useful in simplifying the assumptions in some near
        term error mitigation strategies, see ``measure_observables`` for more information.

        The simplest example is for one qubit. In a noisy device, the probability of accurately
        reading the 0 state might be higher than that of the 1 state; due to e.g. amplitude
        damping. This makes correcting for readout more difficult. In the simplest case, this
        function runs the program normally ``(trials//2)`` times. The other half of the time,
        it will insert an ``X`` gate prior to any ``MEASURE`` instruction and then flip the
        measured classical bit back. Overall this has the effect of symmetrizing the readout error.

        The details. Consider preparing the input bitstring ``|i>`` (in the computational basis) and
        measuring in the Z basis. Then the Confusion matrix for the readout error is specified by
        the probabilities

             p(j|i) := Pr(measured = j | prepared = i ).

        In the case of a single qubit i,j \in [0,1] then:
        there is no readout error if p(0|0) = p(1|1) = 1.
        the readout error is symmetric if p(0|0) = p(1|1) = 1 - epsilon.
        the readout error is asymmetric if p(0|0) != p(1|1).

        If your quantum computer has this kind of asymmetric readout error then
        ``qc.run_symmetrized_readout`` will symmetrize the readout error.

        The readout error above is only asymmetric on a single bit. In practice the confusion
        matrix on n bits need not be symmetric, e.g. for two qubits p(ij|ij) != 1 - epsilon for
        all i,j. In these situations a more sophisticated means of symmetrization is needed; and
        we use orthogonal arrays (OA) built from Hadamard matrices.

        The symmetrization types are specified by an int; the types available are:
        -1 -- exhaustive symmetrization uses every possible combination of flips
        0 -- trivial that is no symmetrization
        1 -- symmetrization using an OA with strength 1
        2 -- symmetrization using an OA with strength 2
        3 -- symmetrization using an OA with strength 3
        In the context of readout symmetrization the strength of the orthogonal array enforces
        the symmetry of the marginal confusion matrices.

        By default a strength 3 OA is used; this ensures expectations of the form
        ``<b_k . b_j . b_i>`` for bits any bits i,j,k will have symmetric readout errors. Here
        expectation of a random variable x as is denote ``<x> = sum_i Pr(i) x_i``. It turns out that
        a strength 3 OA is also a strength 2 and strength 1 OA it also ensures ``<b_j . b_i>`` and
        ``<b_i>`` have symmetric readout errors for any bits b_j and b_i.

    Get a quantum computer.

    A quantum computer is an object of type :py:class:`QuantumComputer` and can be backed
    either by a QVM simulator ("Quantum/Quil Virtual Machine") or a physical Rigetti QPU ("Quantum
    Processing Unit") made of superconducting qubits.

    You can choose the quantum computer to target through a combination of its name and optional
    flags. There are multiple ways to get the same quantum computer. The following are equivalent::

        >>> qc = get_qc("Aspen-1-16Q-A-noisy-qvm")
        >>> qc = get_qc("Aspen-1-16Q-A", as_qvm=True, noisy=True)

    and will construct a simulator of an Aspen-1 lattice with a noise model based on device
    characteristics. We also provide a means for constructing generic quantum simulators that
    are not related to a given piece of Rigetti hardware::

        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-square-qvm")
        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-square", as_qvm=True)

    Finally, you can get request a QVM with "no" topology of a given number of qubits
    (technically, it's a fully connected graph among the given number of qubits) with::

        >>> qc = get_qc("5q-qvm") # or "6q-qvm", or "34q-qvm", ...

    These less-realistic, fully-connected QVMs will also be more lenient on what types of programs
    they will ``run``. Specifically, you do not need to do any compilation. For the other, realistic
    QVMs you must use :py:func:`qc.compile` or :py:func:`qc.compiler.native_quil_to_executable`
    prior to :py:func:`qc.run`.

    The Rigetti QVM must be downloaded from https://www.rigetti.com/forest and run as a server
    alongside your python program. To use pyQuil's built-in QVM, replace all ``"-qvm"`` suffixes
    with ``"-pyqvm"``::

        >>> qc = get_qc("5q-pyqvm")

    Redundant flags are acceptable, but conflicting flags will raise an exception::

        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-square-qvm") # qc is fully specified by its name
        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-square-qvm", as_qvm=True) # redundant, but ok
        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-square-qvm", as_qvm=False) # Error!

    Use :py:func:`list_quantum_computers` to retrieve a list of known qc names.

    This method is provided as a convenience to quickly construct and use QVM's and QPU's.
    Power users may wish to have more control over the specification of a quantum computer
    (e.g. custom noise models, bespoke topologies, etc.). This is possible by constructing
    a :py:class:`QuantumComputer` object by hand. Please refer to the documentation on
    :py:class:`QuantumComputer` for more information.

    :param name: The name of the desired quantum computer. This should correspond to a name
        returned by :py:func:`list_quantum_computers`. Names ending in "-qvm" will return
        a QVM. Names ending in "-pyqvm" will return a :py:class:`PyQVM`. Names ending in
        "-noisy-qvm" will return a QVM with a noise model. Otherwise, we will return a QPU with
        the given name.
    :param as_qvm: An optional flag to force construction of a QVM (instead of a QPU). If
        specified and set to ``True``, a QVM-backed quantum computer will be returned regardless
        of the name's suffix
    :param noisy: An optional flag to force inclusion of a noise model. If
        specified and set to ``True``, a quantum computer with a noise model will be returned
        regardless of the name's suffix. The noise model for QVMs based on a real QPU
        is an empirically parameterized model based on real device noise characteristics.
        The generic QVM noise model is simple T1 and T2 noise plus readout error. See
        :py:func:`~pyquil.noise.decoherence_noise_with_asymmetric_ro`.
    :param connection: An optional :py:class:`ForestConnection` object. If not specified,
        the default values for URL endpoints will be used. If you deign to change any
        of these parameters, pass your own :py:class:`ForestConnection` object.
