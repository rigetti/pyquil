    Get a quantum computer.

    A quantum computer is an object of type :py:class:`QuantumComputer` and can be backed
    either by a QVM simulator ("Quantum/Quil Virtual Machine") or a physical Rigetti QPU ("Quantum
    Processing Unit") made of superconducting qubits.

    You can choose the quantum computer to target through a combination of its name and optional
    flags. There are multiple ways to get the same quantum computer. The following are equivalent::

        >>> qc = get_qc("8Q-Agave-noisy-qvm")
        >>> qc = get_qc("8Q-Agave", as_qvm=True, noisy=True)

    and will construct a simulator of the 8q-agave chip with a noise model based on device
    characteristics. We also provide a means for constructing generic quantum simulators that
    are not related to a given piece of Rigetti hardware::

        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-generic-qvm")
        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-generic", as_qvm=True)

    Finally, you can get request a QVM with "no" topology (technically: a fully connected graph
    among the maximum possible number of qubits you can simulate) with::

        >>> qc = get_qc("qvm")

    Redundant flags are acceptable, but conflicting flags will raise an exception::

        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-generic-qvm") # qc is fully specified by its name
        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-generic-qvm", as_qvm=True) # redundant, but ok
        >>> qc = get_qc("9q-generic-qvm", as_qvm=False) # Error!

    Use :py:func:`list_quantum_computers` to retrieve a list of known qc names.

    This method is provided as a convenience to quickly construct and use QVM's and QPU's.
    Power users may wish to have more control over the specification of a quantum computer
    (e.g. custom noise models, bespoke topologies, etc.). This is possible by constructing
    a :py:class:`QuantumComputer` object by hand. Please refer to the documentation on
    :py:class:`QuantumComputer` for more information.

    :param name: The name of the desired quantum computer. This should correspond to a name
        returned by :py:func:`list_quantum_computers`. Names ending in "-qvm" will return
        a QVM. Names ending in "-noisy-qvm" will return a QVM with a noise model. Otherwise,
        we will return a QPU with the given name.
    :param as_qvm: An optional flag to force construction of a QVM (instead of a QPU). If
        specified and set to ``True``, a QVM-backed quantum computer will be returned regardless
        of the name's suffix
    :param noisy: An optional flag to force inclusion of a noise model. If
        specified and set to ``True``, a quantum computer with a noise model will be returned
        regardless of the name's suffix. The noise model for QVM's based on a real QPU
        is an empirically parameterized model based on real device noise characteristics.
        The generic QVM noise model is simple T1 and T2 noise plus readout error. See
