JobConnection has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use QVMConnection instead.

Note that QVMConnection behaves differently than JobConnection did:
run(), run_and_measure(), wavefunction(), and expectation() all now directly
return the result of the program instead of returning a JobResult object.

This means you need to replace constructs like this:
    qvm = JobConnection()
    job = qvm.run(program, ...)
    wait_for_job(job)
    result = job.result()
with just this:
    qvm = JobConnection()
    result = qvm.run(program, ...)
