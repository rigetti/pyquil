    Note that the matrix must have a compatible tensor structure.
    For example, if you have an 6-qubit state vector ``wf`` with shape

    (2, 2, 2, 2), and you want to apply ``op`` to the 5th and 3rd qubits
    within ``input_state``, then the output state vector is computed as follows::

    This method also works when the right hand side is a matrix instead of a
    vector. If a unitary circuit's matrix is ``old_effect``, and you append
    a CNOT(q1, q4) operation onto the circuit, where the control q1 is the qubit
    at offset 1 and the target q4 is the qubit at offset 4, then the appended
    circuit's unitary matrix is computed as follows::
