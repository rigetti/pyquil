    Merges the list of experiments into a single experiment that runs the sum of the individual

    A group of Experiments whose programs operate on disjoint sets of qubits can be
    'parallelized' so that the total number of runs can be reduced after grouping the settings.
    Settings which act on disjoint sets of qubits can be automatically estimated from the same
    run on the quantum computer.

    If any experiment programs act on a shared qubit they cannot be thoughtlessly composed since
    the order of operations on the shared qubit may have a significant impact on the program
    behaviour; therefore we do not recommend using this method if this is the case.

    Even when the individual experiments act on disjoint sets of qubits you must be
    careful not to associate 'parallel' with 'simultaneous' execution. Physically the gates
    specified in a pyquil Program occur as soon as resources are available; meanwhile, measurement
    happens only after all gates. There is no specification of the exact timing of gates beyond
    their causal relationships. Therefore, while grouping experiments into parallel operation can
    be quite beneficial for time savings, do not depend on any simultaneous execution of gates on
    different qubits, and be wary of the fact that measurement happens only after all gates have
    finished.

    Group experiments that are diagonal in a shared tensor product basis (TPB) to minimize number

    .. rubric:: Background

    Given some PauliTerm operator, the 'natural' tensor product basis to
    diagonalize this term is the one which diagonalizes each Pauli operator in the
    product term-by-term.

    For example, X(1) * Z(0) would be diagonal in the 'natural' tensor product basis
    ``{(|0> +/- |1>)/Sqrt[2]} * {|0>, |1>}``, whereas Z(1) * X(0) would be diagonal
    in the 'natural' tpb ``{|0>, |1>} * {(|0> +/- |1>)/Sqrt[2]}``. The two operators
    commute but are not diagonal in each others 'natural' tpb (in fact, they are
    anti-diagonal in each others 'natural' tpb). This function tests whether two
    operators given as PauliTerms are both diagonal in each others 'natural' tpb.

    Note that for the given example of X(1) * Z(0) and Z(1) * X(0), we can construct
    the following basis which simultaneously diagonalizes both operators::

      -- |0>' = |0> (|+>) + |1> (|->)
      -- |1>' = |0> (|+>) - |1> (|->)
      -- |2>' = |0> (|->) + |1> (|+>)
      -- |3>' = |0> (-|->) + |1> (|+>)

    In this basis, X Z looks like diag(1, -1, 1, -1), and Z X looks like diag(1, 1, -1, -1).
    Notice however that this basis cannot be constructed with single-qubit operations, as each
    of the basis vectors are entangled states.


    .. rubric:: Methods

    The "greedy" method will keep a running set of 'buckets' into which grouped ExperimentSettings
    will be placed. Each new ExperimentSetting considered is assigned to the first applicable
    bucket and a new bucket is created if there are no applicable buckets.

    The "clique-removal" method maps the term grouping problem onto Max Clique graph problem.
    This method constructs a NetworkX graph where an edge exists between two settings that
    share an nTPB and then uses networkx's algorithm for clique removal. This method can give
    you marginally better groupings in certain circumstances, but constructing the
    graph is pretty slow so "greedy" is the default.
