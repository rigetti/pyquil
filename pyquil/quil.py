    Implicitly declare a register named ``ro`` for backwards compatibility with Quil 1.

    There used to be one un-named hunk of classical memory. Now there are variables with
    declarations. Instead of::

        MEASURE 0 [0]

    You must now measure into a named register, idiomatically::

        MEASURE 0 ro[0]

    The ``MEASURE`` instruction will emit this (with a deprecation warning) if you're still
    using bare integers for classical addresses. However, you must also declare memory in the
    new scheme::

        DECLARE ro BIT[8]
        MEASURE 0 ro[0]

    This method will determine if you are in "backwards compatibility mode" and will declare
    a read-out ``ro`` register for you. If you program contains any DECLARE commands or if it
    does not have any MEASURE x ro[x], this will not do anything.

    This behavior is included for backwards compatibility and will be removed in future releases
    of PyQuil. Please DECLARE all memory including ``ro``.
