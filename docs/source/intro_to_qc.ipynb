    "For over twenty years inspiring and fascinating work has brought together one of our most fundamental theories of physics - quantum mechanics - and one of our most powerful technologies - computing. Quantum computing is a beautifully interdiscipliary area with two categories of major impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It reorients the relationship between physics and computer science: physics does not just place restrictions on what computers we can design, it also grants new power and inspiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It promises technology that simulates nature at its most fundamental level, allowing us to access deep problems in quantum chemistry, materials discovery, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get here, we've needed to change our usual intuition in many ways.  This sort of intuition reset will be familiar to many programmers from the first time that they learned object-oriented programming, functional programming, distributed programming, or any one of the other marvelous ways of thinking that have been expressed in code over the years.  Like these other paradigms, quantum computing opens up new potential when the basic concepts are grasped.  Unlike these other examples, quantum computing goes further, requiring something akin to an extension of probability theory.  This extension, and the core of quantum computing, are about linear algebra, so this is where we begin: with linear algebra and probability."

    "#### Probabilistic bits as vector spaces\n",
    "From an operational perspective, a bit is described by the results of measurements of that bit.  Let the possible results of measuring a bit (0 or 1) be represented by orthonormal basis vectors \\\\(\\\\vec{0}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\vec{1}\\\\). We'll call these vectors **outcomes**. These outcomes span a two-dimensional vector space that represents a probabilistic bit. A probabilistic bit can be represented as a vector $$ \\vec{v} = a\\,\\vec{0} + b\\,\\vec{1},$$ where \\\\(a\\\\) represents the probability of the bit being 0 and \\\\(b\\\\) represents the probability of the bit being 1.  This clearly also requires that \\\\(a+b=1\\\\).  In this picture the **system** (the probabilistic bit) is a two-dimensional real vector space and a **state** of a system is a particular vector in that vector space."

    "Quantum mechanics rewrites these rules some.  A quantum bit, called a qubit, is the quantum analog of a bit in that it has two outcomes when it is measured.  Similar to the previous section, a qubit can also be represented in a vector space, but with complex coefficients instead of real ones.  A qubit **system** is a two-dimensional complex vector space, and the **state** of a qubit is a complex vector in that space. Again we will define a basis of outcomes \\\\(\\\\{|\\\\,0\\\\rangle, |\\\\,1\\\\rangle\\\\}\\\\) and let a generic qubit state be written as\n",

    "An important distinction between the probabilistic case described above and the quantum case is that probabilistic states may just mask out ignorance.  For example a coin is physically only 0 or 1 and the probalistic view merely represents our ignorance about which it actually is.  **This is not the case in quantum mechanics**.  The quantum states - as far as we know - cannot mask any underlying state. This is what people mean when they say that there is no \"hidden variable theory\" for quantum mechanics.  These probabilistic quantum states are as real as it gets: they don't describe our knowledge of the quantum system, they describe the physical reality of the system."
