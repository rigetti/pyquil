Modeling noisy quantum gates
============================


Pure states vs. mixed states
----------------------------

Errors in quantum computing can introduce classical uncertainty in what the underlying state is.
When this happens we sometimes need to consider not only wavefunctions but also probabilistic sums of
wavefunctions when we are uncertain as to which one we have. For example, if we think that an X gate
was accidentally applied to a qubit with a 50-50 chance then we would say that there is a 50% chance
we have the :math:`\ket{0}` state and a 50% chance that we have a :math:`\ket{1}` state.
This is called an "impure" or
"mixed"state in that it isn't just a wavefunction (which is pure) but instead a distribution over
wavefunctions. We describe this with something called a density matrix, which is generally an
operator. Pure states have very simple density matrices that we can write as an outer product of a
ket vector :math:`\ket{\psi}` with its own bra version :math:`\bra{\psi}=\ket{\psi}^\dagger`.
For a pure state the density matrix is simply

.. math::

   \rho_\psi = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}.

The expectation value of an operator for a mixed state is given by

.. math::

   \langle X \rangle_\rho = \tr{X \rho}

where :math:`\tr{\cdot}` is the trace of an operator, which is the sum of its diagonal elements
which is independent of choice of basis.
Pure state density matrices satisfy

.. math::

   \rho \text{ is pure } \Leftrightarrow \rho^2 = \rho

which you can easily verify for :math:`\rho_\psi` assuming that the state is normalized.
If we want to describe a situation with classical uncertainty between states :math:`\rho_1` and
:math:`\rho_2`, then we can take their weighted sum

.. math::

   \rho = p \rho_1 + (1-p) \rho_2

where :math:`p\in [0,1]` gives the classical probability that the state is :math:`\rho_1`.

Note that classical uncertainty in the wavefunction is markedly different from superpositions.
We can represent superpositions using wavefunctions, but use density matrices to describe
distributions over wavefunctions. You can read more about density matrices here
[DensityMatrix]_.

Quantum gate errors
-------------------

For a quantum gate given by its unitary operator :math:`U`, a "quantum
gate error" describes the scenario in which the actually induces
transformation deviates from :math:`\ket{\psi} \mapsto U\ket{\psi}`.
There are two basic types of quantum gate errors:

1. **coherent errors** are those that preserve the purity of the input
   state, i.e., instead of the above mapping we carry out a perturbed,
   but unitary operation :math:`\ket{\psi} \mapsto \tilde{U}\ket{\psi}`,
   where :math:`\tilde{U} \neq U`.
2. **incoherent errors** are those that do not preserve the purity of
   the input state, in this case we must actually represent the
   evolution in terms of density matrices. The state
   :math:`\rho := \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}` is then mapped as

   .. math::


      \rho \mapsto \sum_{j=1}^n K_j\rho K_j^\dagger, 

   where the operators :math:`\{K_1, K_2, \dots, K_m\}` are called
   Kraus operators and must obey
   :math:`\sum_{j=1}^m K_j^\dagger K_j = I` to conserve the trace of
   :math:`\rho`. Maps expressed in the above form are called Kraus maps.
   It can be shown that every physical map on a finite dimensional
   quantum system can be represented as a Kraus map, though this
   representation is not generally unique. `You can find more
   information about quantum operations
   here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_operation#Kraus_operators>`__

In a way, coherent errors are *in principle* amendable by more precisely
calibrated control. Incoherent errors are more tricky.

Why do incoherent errors happen?
--------------------------------

When a quantum system (e.g., the qubits on a quantum processor) is not
perfectly isolated from its environment it generally co-evolves with the
degrees of freedom it couples to. The implication is that while the
total time evolution of system and environment can be assumed to be
unitary, restriction to the system state generally is not.

**Let's throw some math at this for clarity:** Let our total Hilbert
space be given by the tensor product of system and environment Hilbert
spaces: :math:`\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_S \otimes \mathcal{H}_E`. Our
system "not being perfectly isolated" must be translated to the
statement that the global Hamiltonian contains a contribution that
couples the system and environment:

.. math::


   H = H_S \otimes I + I \otimes H_E + V

where :math:`V` non-trivally acts on both the system and the
environment. Consequently, even if we started in an initial state that
factorized over system and environment
:math:`\ket{\psi}_{S,0}\otimes \ket{\psi}_{E,0}` if everything evolves
by the Schr√∂dinger equation

.. math::


   \ket{\psi_t} = e^{-i \frac{Ht}{\hbar}} \left(\ket{\psi}_{S,0}\otimes \ket{\psi}_{E,0}\right)

the final state will generally not admit such a factorization.

A toy model
-----------

**In this (somewhat technical) section we show how environment
interaction can corrupt an identity gate and derive its Kraus map.** For
simplicity, let us assume that we are in a reference frame in which both
the system and environment Hamiltonian's vanish :math:`H_S = 0, H_E = 0`
and where the cross-coupling is small even when multiplied by the
duration of the time evolution
:math:`\|\frac{tV}{\hbar}\|^2 \sim \epsilon \ll 1` (any operator norm
:math:`\|\cdot\|` will do here). Let us further assume that
:math:`V = \sqrt{\epsilon} V_S \otimes V_E` (the more general case is
given by a sum of such terms) and that the initial environment state
satisfies :math:`\bra{\psi}_{E,0} V_E\ket{\psi}_{E,0} = 0`. This turns
out to be a very reasonable assumption in practice but a more thorough
discussion exceeds our scope.

Then the joint system + environment state
:math:`\rho = \rho_{S,0} \otimes \rho_{E,0}` (now written as a density
matrix) evolves as

.. math::


   \rho \mapsto \rho' :=  e^{-i \frac{Vt}{\hbar}} \rho e^{+i \frac{Vt}{\hbar}}

Using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff theorem we can expand this to second
order in :math:`\epsilon`

.. math::


   \rho' = \rho - \frac{it}{\hbar} [V, \rho] - \frac{t^2}{2\hbar^2} [V, [V, \rho]] + O(\epsilon^{3/2})

We can insert the initially factorizable state
:math:`\rho = \rho_{S,0} \otimes \rho_{E,0}` and trace over the
environmental degrees of freedom to obtain


.. math::


   \begin{align}
   \rho_S' := \tr{\rho'}_E & = \rho_{S,0}  \underbrace{\tr{\rho_{E,0}}_{1}} - \frac{i\sqrt{\epsilon} t}{\hbar} \underbrace{\left[ V_S \rho_{S,0} \underbrace{\tr{V_E\rho_{E,0}}}_{\bra{\psi}_{E,0} V_E\ket{\psi}_{E,0} = 0} - \rho_{S,0}V_S  \underbrace{\tr{\rho_{E,0}V_E}}_{\bra{\psi}_{E,0} V_E\ket{\psi}_{E,0} = 0} \right]}_0 \\
   & - \frac{\epsilon t^2}{2\hbar^2} \left[ V_S^2\rho_{S,0}\tr{V_E^2 \rho_{E,0}} + \rho_{S,0} V_S^2 \tr{\rho_{E,0}V_E^2} - 2 V_S\rho_{S,0}V_S\tr{V_E \rho_{E,0}V_E}\right] \\
   & = \rho_{S,0} - \frac{\gamma}{2} \left[ V_S^2\rho_{S,0} + \rho_{S,0} V_S^2  - 2 V_S\rho_{S,0}V_S\right]
   \end{align}

where the coefficient in front of the second part is by our initial
assumption very small
:math:`\gamma := \frac{\epsilon t^2}{2\hbar^2}\tr{V_E^2 \rho_{E,0}} \ll 1`.
This evolution happens to be approximately equal to a Kraus map with
operators
:math:`K_1 := I - \frac{\gamma}{2} V_S^2, K_2:= \sqrt{\gamma} V_S`:

.. math::

   \begin{align}
   \rho_S \to \rho_S' &= K_1\rho K_1^\dagger + K_2\rho K_2^\dagger
    = \rho - \frac{\gamma}{2}\left[ V_S^2 \rho + \rho V_S^2\right] + \gamma V_S\rho_S V_S + O(\gamma^2)
   \end{align}

This agrees to :math:`O(\epsilon^{3/2})` with the result of our
derivation above. This type of derivation can be extended to many other
cases with little complication and a very similar argument is used to
derive the `Lindblad master
equation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindblad_equation>`__.

Support for noisy gates on the Rigetti QVM
------------------------------------------

As of today, users of our Forest API can annotate their QUIL programs by
certain pragma statements that inform the QVM that a particular gate on
specific target qubits should be replaced by an imperfect realization
given by a Kraus map.

But the QVM propagates *pure states*: How does it simulate noisy gates?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It does so by yielding the correct outcomes **in the average over many
executions of the QUIL program**: When the noisy version of a gate
should be applied the QVM makes a random choice which Kraus operator is
applied to the current state with a probability that ensures that the
average over many executions is equivalent to the Kraus map. In
particular, a particular Kraus operator :math:`K_j` is applied to
:math:`\ket{\psi}_S`

.. math::


   \ket{\psi'}_S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{p_j}} K_j \ket{\psi}_S

with probability
:math:`p_j:= \bra{\psi}_S K_j^\dagger K_j \ket{\psi}_S`. In the average
over many execution :math:`N \gg 1` we therefore find that

.. math::

   \begin{align}
   \overline{\rho_S'} & = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \ket{\psi'_n}_S\bra{\psi'_n}_S \\
   & = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N p_{j_n}^{-1}K_{j_n}\ket{\psi'}_S \bra{\psi'}_SK_{j_n}^\dagger
   \end{align}

where :math:`j_n` is the chosen Kraus operator label in the :math:`n`-th
trial. This is clearly a Kraus map itself! And we can group identical
terms and rewrite it as

.. math::

   \begin{align}
   \overline{\rho_S'} & = 
     \sum_{\ell=1}^n \frac{N_\ell}{N}  p_{\ell}^{-1}K_{\ell}\ket{\psi'}_S \bra{\psi'}_SK_{\ell}^\dagger
   \end{align}

where :math:`N_{\ell}` is the number of times that Kraus operator label
:math:`\ell` was selected. For large enough :math:`N` we know that
:math:`N_{\ell} \approx N p_\ell` and therefore

.. math::

   \begin{align}
   \overline{\rho_S'} \approx \sum_{\ell=1}^n K_{\ell}\ket{\psi'}_S \bra{\psi'}_SK_{\ell}^\dagger
   \end{align}

which proves our claim. **The consequence is that noisy gate simulations
must generally be repeated many times to obtain representative
results**.

How do I get started?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Come up with a good model for your noise. We will provide some
   examples below and may add more such examples to our public
   repositories over time. Alternatively, you can characterize the gate
   under consideration using `Quantum Process
   Tomography <https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5344>`__ or `Gate Set
   Tomography <http://www.pygsti.info/>`__ and use the resulting process
   matrices to obtain a very accurate noise model for a particular QPU.
2. Define your Kraus operators as a list of numpy arrays
   ``kraus_ops = [K1, K2, ..., Km]``.
3. For your QUIL program ``p``, call:

   ::

       p.define_noisy_gate("MY_NOISY_GATE", [q1, q2], kraus_ops)

   where you should replace ``MY_NOISY_GATE`` with the gate of interest
   and ``q1, q2`` the indices of the qubits.

Example 1: Amplitude damping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amplitude damping channels are imperfect identity maps with Kraus
operators

.. math::


   K_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 
   1 & 0 \\
   0 & \sqrt{1-p}
   \end{pmatrix} \\
   K_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 
   0 & \sqrt{p} \\
   0 & 0
   \end{pmatrix}

where :math:`p` is the probability that a qubit in the :math:`\ket{1}`
state decays to the :math:`\ket{0}` state.

Example 2: dephased CZ-gate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dephasing is usually characterized through a qubit's :math:`T_2` time.
For a single qubit the dephasing Kraus operators are

.. math::


   K_1(p) = \sqrt{1-p} I_2 \\
   K_2(p) = \sqrt{p} \sigma_Z

where :math:`p = 1 - \exp(-T_2/T_{\rm gate})` is the probability that
the qubit is dephased over the time interval of interest, :math:`I_2` is
the :math:`2\times 2`-identity matrix and :math:`\sigma_Z` is the
Pauli-Z operator.

For two qubits, we must construct a Kraus map that has *four* different
outcomes:

1. No dephasing
2. Qubit 1 dephases
3. Qubit 2 dephases
4. Both dephase

The Kraus operators for this are given by

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{align}
   K'_1(p,q) = K_1(p)\otimes K_1(q) \\
   K'_2(p,q) = K_2(p)\otimes K_1(q) \\
   K'_3(p,q) = K_1(p)\otimes K_2(q) \\
   K'_4(p,q) = K_2(p)\otimes K_2(q) 
   \end{align}

where we assumed a dephasing probability :math:`p` for the first qubit
and :math:`q` for the second.

Dephasing is a *diagonal* error channel and the CZ gate is also
diagonal, therefore we can get the combined map of dephasing and the CZ
gate simply by composing :math:`U_{\rm CZ}` the unitary representation
of CZ with each Kraus operator

.. math::

   \begin{align}
   K^{\rm CZ}_1(p,q) = K_1(p)\otimes K_1(q)U_{\rm CZ} \\
   K^{\rm CZ}_2(p,q) = K_2(p)\otimes K_1(q)U_{\rm CZ} \\
   K^{\rm CZ}_3(p,q) = K_1(p)\otimes K_2(q)U_{\rm CZ} \\
   K^{\rm CZ}_4(p,q) = K_2(p)\otimes K_2(q)U_{\rm CZ} 
   \end{align}

**Note that this is not always accurate, because a CZ gate is often
achieved through non-diagonal interaction Hamiltonians! However, for
sufficiently small dephasing probabilities it should always provide a
good starting point.**
