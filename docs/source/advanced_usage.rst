Advanced Usage
==============

.. note::

    If you're running locally, remember set up the QVM and quilc in server mode before trying to use
    them: :ref:`server`.

.. _pyquil_configuration:

pyQuil Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:py:class:`~pyquil.api.QCSClientConfiguration` instructs pyQuil on how to connect with the
components needed to compile and run programs (quilc, QVMs, and QCS). Any APIs that take a configuration object
as input (e.g. :py:func:`~pyquil.get_qc()`) typically do so optionally, so that a default configuration can be loaded
for you if one is not provided. You can override this default configuration by either instantiating your own
:py:class:`~pyquil.api.QCSClientConfiguration` object and providing it as input to the function in question,
or by setting the ``QCS_SETTINGS_FILE_PATH`` and/or ``QCS_SECRETS_FILE_PATH`` environment variables to have
pyQuil load its settings and secrets from specific locations. By default, configuration will be loaded from
``$HOME/.qcs/settings.toml`` and ``$HOME/.qcs/secrets.toml``.

Additionally, you can override whichever QVM and quilc URLs are loaded from ``settings.toml``
(``profiles.<profile>.applications.pyquil.qvm_url`` and ``profiles.<profile>.applications.pyquil.quilc_url`` fields)
by setting the ``QCS_SETTINGS_APPLICATIONS_PYQUIL_QVM_URL`` and/or ``QCS_SETTINGS_APPLICATIONS_PYQUIL_QUILC_URL``
environment variables. If these URLs are missing from ``settings.toml`` and are not set by environment variables,
the following defaults will be used (as they correspond to the default behavior of the QVM and quilc when running
locally):

- QVM URL: ``http://127.0.0.1:5000``
- quilc URL: ``tcp://127.0.0.1:5555``

Concurrency
~~~~~~~~~~~

Using pyQuil for concurrent programming is as simple as calling :py:func:`~pyquil.get_qc()` from within a given thread
or process, then using the returned :py:class:`~pyquil.api.QuantumComputer` as usual. While
:py:class:`~pyquil.api.QuantumComputer` objects as a whole are not safe to share between threads or processes (due to
state related to currently-running compilation or execution requests), some information they use is. Information related
to client configuration (:py:class:`~pyquil.api.QCSClientConfiguration`) and QPU auth
(:py:class:`~pyquil.api.EngagementManager`) can be safely extracted and shared among
:py:class:`~pyquil.api.QuantumComputer` instances, as shown below, to save your code from redundant disk reads and
auth-related HTTP requests.

.. note::
    The QVM processes incoming requests in parallel, while a QPU may process them sequentially or in parallel
    (depending on the qubits used). If you encounter timeouts while trying to run large numbers of programs against a
    QPU, try increasing the ``execution_timeout`` parameter on calls  to :py:func:`~pyquil.get_qc()` (specified in
    seconds).

Using Multithreading
--------------------

.. code:: python

    from multiprocessing.pool import ThreadPool

    from pyquil import get_qc, Program
    from pyquil.api import EngagementManager, QCSClientConfiguration


    configuration = QCSClientConfiguration.load()
    engagement_manager = EngagementManager(client_configuration=configuration)


    def run(program: Program):
        qc = get_qc("Aspen-8", client_configuration=configuration, engagement_manager=engagement_manager)
        return qc.run(qc.compile(program))


    programs = [Program("DECLARE ro BIT", "RX(pi) 0", "MEASURE 0 ro").wrap_in_numshots_loop(10)] * 20
    with ThreadPool(5) as pool:
        results = pool.map(run, programs)

    for i, result in enumerate(results):
        print(f"Results for program {i}:\n{result}\n")


Using Multiprocessing
---------------------

.. code:: python

    from multiprocessing.pool import Pool

    from pyquil import get_qc, Program
    from pyquil.api import EngagementManager, QCSClientConfiguration


    configuration = QCSClientConfiguration.load()
    engagement_manager = EngagementManager(client_configuration=configuration)


    def run(program: Program):
        qc = get_qc("Aspen-8", client_configuration=configuration, engagement_manager=engagement_manager)
        return qc.run(qc.compile(program))


    programs = [Program("DECLARE ro BIT", "RX(pi) 0", "MEASURE 0 ro").wrap_in_numshots_loop(10)] * 20
    with Pool(5) as pool:
        results = pool.map(run, programs)

    for i, result in enumerate(results):
        print(f"Results for program {i}:\n{result}\n")

.. note::
    If you encounter error messages on macOS similar to the following:

    .. parsed-literal::
        +[__NSCFConstantString initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.

    try setting the environment variable ``OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES``.


Using Qubit Placeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    The functionality provided inline by ``QubitPlaceholders`` is similar to writing a function which returns a
    ``Program``, with qubit indices taken as arguments to the function.

In pyQuil, we typically use integers to identify qubits

.. code:: python

    from pyquil import Program
    from pyquil.gates import CNOT, H
    print(Program(H(0), CNOT(0, 1)))

.. parsed-literal::

    H 0
    CNOT 0 1

However, when running on real, near-term QPUs we care about what
particular physical qubits our program will run on. In fact, we may want
to run the same program on an assortment of different qubits. This is
where using ``QubitPlaceholder``\ s comes in.

.. code:: python

    from pyquil.quilatom import QubitPlaceholder
    q0 = QubitPlaceholder()
    q1 = QubitPlaceholder()
    p = Program(H(q0), CNOT(q0, q1))
    print(p)

.. parsed-literal::

    H {q4402789176}
    CNOT {q4402789176} {q4402789120}

If you try to use this program directly, it will not work

.. code:: python

    print(p.out())

::

    RuntimeError: Qubit q4402789176 has not been assigned an index


Instead, you must explicitly map the placeholders to physical qubits. By
default, the function ``address_qubits`` will address qubits from 0 to
N.

.. code:: python

    from pyquil.quil import address_qubits
    print(address_qubits(p))

.. parsed-literal::

    H 0
    CNOT 0 1

The real power comes into play when you provide an explicit mapping:

.. code:: python

    print(address_qubits(prog, qubit_mapping={
        q0: 14,
        q1: 19,
    }))

.. parsed-literal::

    H 14
    CNOT 14 19


Register
--------

Usually, your algorithm will use an assortment of qubits. You can use
the convenience function ``QubitPlaceholder.register()`` to request a
list of qubits to build your program.

.. code:: python

    qbyte = QubitPlaceholder.register(8)
    p_evens = Program(H(q) for q in qbyte)
    print(address_qubits(p_evens, {q: i*2 for i, q in enumerate(qbyte)}))


.. parsed-literal::

    H 0
    H 2
    H 4
    H 6
    H 8
    H 10
    H 12
    H 14

Classical Control Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Classical control flow is not yet supported on the QPU.


Here are a couple quick examples that show how much richer a Quil program
can be with classical control flow. In this first example, we create a while
loop by following these steps:

1. Declare a register called ``flag_register`` to use as a boolean test for looping.

2. Initialize this register to ``1``, so our while loop will execute. This is often called the
   *loop preamble* or *loop initialization*.

3. Write the body of the loop in its own :py:class:`~pyquil.quil.Program`. This will be a
   program that applies an :math:`X` gate followed by an :math:`H` gate on our
   qubit.

4. Use the :py:func:`~pyquil.quil.Program.while_do` method to add control flow.

.. code:: python

    from pyquil import Program
    from pyquil.gates import *

    # Initialize the Program and declare a 1 bit memory space for our boolean flag
    outer_loop = Program()
    flag_register = outer_loop.declare('flag_register', 'BIT')

    # Set the initial flag value to 1
    outer_loop += MOVE(flag_register, 1)

    # Define the body of the loop with a new Program
    inner_loop = Program()
    inner_loop += Program(X(0), H(0))
    inner_loop += MEASURE(0, flag_register)

    # Run inner_loop in a loop until flag_register is 0
    outer_loop.while_do(flag_register, inner_loop)

    print(outer_loop)

.. parsed-literal::

    DECLARE flag_register BIT[1]
    MOVE flag_register 1
    LABEL @START1
    JUMP-UNLESS @END2 flag_register
    X 0
    H 0
    MEASURE 0 flag_register
    JUMP @START1
    LABEL @END2

Notice that the ``outer_loop`` program applied a Quil instruction directly to a
classical register.  There are several classical commands that can be used in this fashion:

- ``NOT`` which flips a classical bit
- ``AND`` which operates on two classical bits
- ``IOR`` which operates on two classical bits
- ``MOVE`` which moves the value of a classical bit at one classical address into another
- ``EXCHANGE`` which swaps the value of two classical bits

In this next example, we show how to do conditional branching in the
form of the traditional ``if`` construct as in many programming
languages. Much like the last example, we construct programs for each
branch of the ``if``, and put it all together by using the :py:func:`~pyquil.quil.Program.if_then`
method.

.. code:: python

    # Declare our memory spaces
    branching_prog = Program()
    test_register = branching_prog.declare('test_register', 'BIT')
    ro = branching_prog.declare('ro', 'BIT')

    # Construct each branch of our if-statement. We can have empty branches
    # simply by having empty programs.
    then_branch = Program(X(0))
    else_branch = Program()

    # Construct our program so that the result in test_register is equally likely to be a 0 or 1
    branching_prog += H(1)
    branching_prog += MEASURE(1, test_register)

    # Add the conditional branching
    branching_prog.if_then(test_register, then_branch, else_branch)

    # Measure qubit 0 into our readout register
    branching_prog += MEASURE(0, ro)

    print(branching_prog)

.. parsed-literal::

    DECLARE test_register BIT[1]
    DECLARE ro BIT[1]
    H 1
    MEASURE 1 test_register
    JUMP-WHEN @THEN1 test_register
    JUMP @END2
    LABEL @THEN1
    X 0
    LABEL @END2
    MEASURE 0 ro

We can run this program a few times to see what we get in the readout register ``ro``.

.. code:: python

    from pyquil import get_qc

    qc = get_qc("2q-qvm")
    branching_prog.wrap_in_numshots_loop(10)
    qc.run(branching_prog)

.. parsed-literal::

    [[1], [1], [1], [0], [1], [0], [0], [1], [1], [0]]


Pauli Operator Algebra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many algorithms require manipulating sums of Pauli combinations, such as
:math:`\sigma = \frac{1}{2}I - \frac{3}{4}X_0Y_1Z_3 + (5-2i)Z_1X_2,` where
:math:`G_n` indicates the gate :math:`G` acting on qubit :math:`n`. We
can represent such sums by constructing ``PauliTerm`` and ``PauliSum``.
The above sum can be constructed as follows:

.. code:: python

    from pyquil.paulis import ID, sX, sY, sZ

    # Pauli term takes an operator "X", "Y", "Z", or "I"; a qubit to act on, and
    # an optional coefficient.
    a = 0.5 * ID()
    b = -0.75 * sX(0) * sY(1) * sZ(3)
    c = (5-2j) * sZ(1) * sX(2)

    # Construct a sum of Pauli terms.
    sigma = a + b + c
    print(f"sigma = {sigma}")

.. parsed-literal::

    sigma = (0.5+0j)*I + (-0.75+0j)*X0*Y1*Z3 + (5-2j)*Z1*X2

Right now, the primary thing one can do with Pauli terms and sums is to construct the
exponential of the Pauli term, i.e., :math:`\exp[-i\beta\sigma]`.  This is
accomplished by constructing a parameterized Quil program that is evaluated
when passed values for the coefficients of the angle :math:`\beta`.

Related to exponentiating Pauli sums, we provide utility functions for finding
the commuting subgroups of a Pauli sum and approximating the exponential with the
Suzuki-Trotter approximation through fourth order.

When arithmetic is done with Pauli sums, simplification is automatically
done.

The following shows an instructive example of all three.

.. code:: python

    from pyquil.paulis import exponential_map

    sigma_cubed = sigma * sigma * sigma
    print(f"Simplified: {sigma_cubed}\n")

    # Produce Quil code to compute exp[iX]
    H = -1.0 * sX(0)
    print(f"Quil to compute exp[iX] on qubit 0:\n"
           f"{exponential_map(H)(1.0)}")

.. parsed-literal::

    Simplified: (32.46875-30j)*I + (-16.734375+15j)*X0*Y1*Z3 + (71.5625-144.625j)*Z1*X2

    Quil to compute exp[iX] on qubit 0:
    H 0
    RZ(-2.0) 0
    H 0

``exponential_map`` returns a function allowing you to fill in a multiplicative
constant later. This commonly occurs in variational algorithms. The function
``exponential_map`` is used to compute :math:`\exp[-i \alpha H]` without explicitly filling in a
value for :math:`\alpha`.

.. code:: python

    expH = exponential_map(H)
    print(f"0:\n{expH(0.0)}\n")
    print(f"1:\n{expH(1.0)}\n")
    print(f"2:\n{expH(2.0)}")

.. parsed-literal::
    0:
    H 0
    RZ(0) 0
    H 0

    1:
    H 0
    RZ(-2.0) 0
    H 0

    2:
    H 0
    RZ(-4.0) 0
    H 0

To take it one step further, you can use :ref:`parametric_compilation` with ``exponential_map``. For instance:

.. code:: python

    ham = sZ(0) * sZ(1)
    prog = Program()
    theta = prog.declare('theta', 'REAL')
    prog += exponential_map(ham)(theta)
