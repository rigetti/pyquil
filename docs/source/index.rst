===============================
Welcome to the docs for pyQuil!
===============================

As a part of the Quil SDK, pyQuil allows you to build and execute Quil programs using Python. pyQuil
requires installation of the other components of the Quil SDK, namely the Quil compiler (quilc) and the Quantum Virtual
Machine (QVM), used for simulating quantum computers. You can also use pyQuil to run programs on real quantum computers
using `Rigetti's Quantum Cloud Services (QCS) <https://docs.rigetti.com/qcs/>`_.

To learn more about Quil, the Quil SDK, and QCS, see `Rigetti's documentation <https://docs.rigetti.com>`_.

If youâ€™re new to pyQuil, head to the `getting started <getting_started>`_ guide to get setup and run your first program!

.. note::

   If you've used pyQuil before, be sure to check out :ref:`introducing_v4` to help get oriented on the key changes in v4.
