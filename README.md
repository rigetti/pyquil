PyQuil is a Python library for quantum programming using [Quil](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03355),
the quantum instruction language developed at [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com/).
PyQuil serves three main functions:

- Easily generating Quil programs from quantum gates and classical operations
- Compiling and simulating Quil programs using the [Quil Compiler](https://github.com/rigetti/quilc)
  (quilc) and the [Quantum Virtual Machine](https://github.com/rigetti/qvm) (QVM)
- Executing Quil programs on real quantum processors (QPUs) using
  [Quantum Cloud Services](https://www.rigetti.com/qcs) (QCS)

PyQuil has a ton of other features, which you can learn more about in the
[docs](http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, you can also keep reading
below to get started with running your first quantum program!

Installation
------------

**Please Note: PyQuil, along with quilc, the QVM, and other libraries, make up what
is called the Forest SDK. To make full use of pyQuil's functionality, you will need
to additionally have installed [quilc](https://github.com/rigetti/quilc) and the
[QVM](https://github.com/rigetti/qvm). This can be done by following their respective
READMEs, or by downloading them as binaries from [here](https://rigetti.com/forest).**

PyQuil can be installed using `conda`, `pip`, or directly from source.

To install pyQuil as a `conda` package from the conda-forge channel (recommended), do the following:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pyquil
```

To instead install pyQuil as a PyPI package, do the following:

```bash
pip install pyquil
```

Finally, if you would prefer to install pyQuil directly from source, do the following
from within the repository after cloning it:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

If you choose to use `pip`, we highly recommend installing pyQuil within a virtual environment.

Getting Started
---------------

In just a few lines, we can use pyQuil with the Forest SDK to simulate a Bell state!

```python
from pyquil import get_qc, Program
from pyquil.gates import CNOT, H, MEASURE
 
qvm = get_qc('2q-qvm')
 
p = Program()
p += H(0)
p += CNOT(0, 1)
ro = p.declare('ro', 'BIT', 2)
p += MEASURE(0, ro[0])
p += MEASURE(1, ro[1])
p.wrap_in_numshots_loop(10)
 
qvm.run(p).tolist()
```

The output of the above program should look something like the following,
the statistics of which are consistent with a two-qubit entangled state.

```
[[0, 0],
 [1, 1],
 [1, 1],
 [1, 1],
 [1, 1],
 [0, 0],
 [0, 0],
 [1, 1],
 [0, 0],
 [0, 0]]
```

Joining the Forest Community
----------------------------

If you'd like to get involved with pyQuil and Forest, joining the [Rigetti Forest Slack
Workspace][slack_invite]
is a great place to start! You can do so by clicking the invite link in the previous sentence,
or in the badge at the top of this README. The Slack Workspace is a great place to ask general
questions, join high-level design discussions, and hear about updates to pyQuil and the Forest SDK.

To go a step further and start contributing to the development of pyQuil, good first steps are

Running on the QPU
------------------

Using the Forest SDK, you can simulate the operation of a real quantum processor. If you
would like to run on the real QPUs in our lab in Berkeley, you can sign up for an account
on [Quantum Cloud Services](https://www.rigetti.com/qcs)!
