# pyQuil

A library for easily generating Quil programs to be executed using the Rigetti Forest platform.
pyQuil is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/rigetti/pyQuil/blob/master/LICENSE).

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/rigetti/pyquil/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/rigetti/pyquil)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyquil/badge/?version=latest)](http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Documentation

Documentation is hosted at [http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Installation

You can install pyQuil as a conda package (recommended):

```bash
conda install -c rigetti pyquil
```

or using `pip`:

```
pip install pyquil
```

To instead install pyQuil from source, clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run:
```
pip install -e .
```

## Connecting to Rigetti Forest

pyQuil can be used to build and manipulate Quil programs without restriction. However, to run
programs (e.g., to get wavefunctions, get multishot experiment data), you will need an API key
for [Rigetti Forest](http://forest.rigetti.com). This will allow you to run your programs on the
Rigetti Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) or on a real quantum processor (QPU).

Once you have your key, run the following command to automatically set up your config:

```
pyquil-config-setup
```

You can also create the configuration file manually if you'd like and place it at `~/.pyquil_config`.
The configuration file is in INI format and should contain all the information required to connect to Forest:

```
[Rigetti Forest]
key: <Rigetti Forest API key>
user_id: <Rigetti User ID>
```

You can change the location of this file by setting the `PYQUIL_CONFIG` environment variable.

If you encounter errors or warnings trying to connect to Forest then see the full
[Getting Started Guide](https://go.rigetti.com/getting-started)

## Examples using the Rigetti QVM

Here is how to construct a Bell state program and how to compute the amplitudes of its wavefunction:

```python
>>> from pyquil.quil import Program
>>> from pyquil.api import QVMConnection
>>> from pyquil.gates import *
>>> qvm = QVMConnection()
>>> p = Program(H(0), CNOT(0,1))
<pyquil.pyquil.Program object at 0x101ebfb50>
>>> qvm.wavefunction(p).amplitudes
array([0.7071067811865475+0j, 0j, 0j, 0.7071067811865475+0j])
```

How to do a simulated multishot experiment measuring qubits 0 and 1 of a Bell state. (Of course,
each measurement pair will be `00` or `11`.)

```python
>>> from pyquil.quil import Program
>>> from pyquil.api import QVMConnection
>>> from pyquil.gates import *
>>> qvm = QVMConnection()
>>> p = Program()
>>> p.inst(H(0),
...        CNOT(0, 1),
...        MEASURE(0, 0),
...        MEASURE(1, 1))
<pyquil.pyquil.Program object at 0x101ebfc50>
>>> print(p)
H 0
CNOT 0 1
MEASURE 0 [0]
MEASURE 1 [1]

>>> qvm.run(p, [0, 1], 10)
[[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]
```
