# pyQuil

A library for easily generating Quil programs to be executed using the Rigetti Forest platform.
pyQuil is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyQuil/blob/master/LICENSE).

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/rigetti/pyquil/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/rigetti/pyquil)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyquil/badge/?version=latest)](http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Documentation

Documentation is hosted at [http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Installation

You can install pyQuil directly from the Python package manager `pip` using:
```
pip install pyquil
```

To instead install pyQuil from source, clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run:
```
pip install -e .
```

This will also install pyQuil's dependencies (requests >= 2.4.2 and NumPy >= 1.10)
if you do not already have them.

## Connecting to the Rigetti Forest

pyQuil can be used to build and manipulate Quil programs without restriction. However, to run
programs (e.g., to get wavefunctions, get multishot experiment data), you will need an API key
for [Rigetti Forest](http://forest.rigetti.com). This will allow you to run your programs on the
Rigetti Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) or on a real quantum processor (QPU).

Once you have your key, you need to set up configuration in the file `.pyquil_config` which
pyQuil will attempt to find in your home directory by default. (You can change this location by setting the
environment variable `PYQUIL_CONFIG` to the path of the file.) Loading the `pyquil.forest` module
will print a warning if this is not found. The configuration file is in INI format and should
contain all the information required to connect to Forest:

```ini
[Rigetti Forest]
url: <URL to Rigetti Forest or QVM endpoint>
key: <Rigetti Forest API key>
```

If `url` is not specified, it will default to `https://api.rigetti.com/qvm`. In addition to the
above, the fields `https_cert` and `https_key` are supported for direct HTTPS connections to QVMs.

```ini
https_cert: <path to signed HTTPS certificate and key>
https_key: <path to separate key file, if different from the above>
```

## Examples using the Rigetti QVM

Here is how to construct a Bell state program and how to compute the amplitudes of its wavefunction:

```python
>>> import pyquil.quil as pq
>>> import pyquil.forest as forest
>>> from pyquil.gates import *
>>> qvm = forest.Connection()
>>> p = pq.Program(H(0), CNOT(0,1))
<pyquil.pyquil.Program object at 0x101ebfb50>
>>> qvm.wavefunction(p)[0]
[(0.7071067811865475+0j), 0j, 0j, (0.7071067811865475+0j)]
```

How to do a simulated multishot experiment measuring qubits 0 and 1 of a Bell state. (Of course,
each measurement pair will be `00` or `11`.)

```python
>>> import pyquil.quil as pq
>>> import pyquil.forest as forest
>>> from pyquil.gates import *
>>> qvm = forest.Connection()
>>> p = pq.Program()
>>> p.inst(H(0),
...        CNOT(0, 1),
...        MEASURE(0, 0),
...        MEASURE(1, 1))
<pyquil.pyquil.Program object at 0x101ebfc50>
>>> print p
H 0
CNOT 0 1
MEASURE 0 [0]
MEASURE 1 [1]

>>> qvm.run(p, [0, 1], 10)
[[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]
```

## Building the Docs

We use sphinx to build the documentation. To do this, navigate into pyQuil's top-level directory and run:

```
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/_build
```
To view the docs navigate to the newly-created `docs/_build` directory and open
the `index.html` file in a browser. Note that we use the Read the Docs theme for
our documentation, so this may need to be installed using `pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`.

## Development and Testing

We use pytest (version > 3.0) for testing. After installing pytest with `pip`, tests can be run from the top-level directory using:
```
pytest
```
